# ## Example
#
# ```yaml
# observed_at: 2025-02-04
# target: February
# ```
#
# The answer is shown here for explanation; it is hidden from the model when scored.

# //| label: fig-proof-temporal-month-from-day-of-year
# //| fig-cap: "Amber cards are hidden prediction targets. Other fields provide the input."
# //| fig-alt: "Model tree with calendar, observed_at, target. Amber cards are hidden prediction targets. Other fields provide the input."

#   node("observed_at", type: "DateParts", width: 150pt,),
#   node("target", kind: "target", type: "Category", detail: "month",),
# )))
# ```
#
# ## Comparison
#
# Train on odd days of each month, test even days in unseen years, and shuffle timestamps while keeping month answers fixed.
#
# ## Result
#
# {{< proof P044 status >}}
#
# The model learns the restricted calendar relationship. Exact month extraction is simpler in preprocessing, and leap-year ambiguity needs additional information.

# ### Run this experiment
#
# {{< proof P044 script >}}
#
# ### How it works
#
# In a non-leap calendar, day-of-year determines month. The model must learn
# the intervals in that cyclic representation. Training uses odd-numbered
# days of each month in 2017–2019; validation uses odd days in 2021. Test dates
# are even-numbered days in 2023 and 2025. All these years are non-leap.
#
# After 70 deterministic epochs, the test evaluates both the original
# held-out data and a version with timestamps permuted while labels stay put.
# Permutation preserves the marginals but destroys the useful relationship.
#
# ### Remaining work
#
# Repeat the gates over three core seeds and at least ten calibration seeds.
# Extend the family to week and multi-coordinate targets. Characterize timezone,
# daylight-saving, and leap-day preprocessing policies separately rather than
# assuming that DateParts adds those semantics.

"""P044: learn month from day-of-year on unseen dates and years.

Only non-leap years are used. Training dates are odd days of the month;
held-out dates are even days in new years. Timestamp permutation retains the
labels and date marginals while removing their relationship.
