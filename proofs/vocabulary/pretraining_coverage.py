# title: Does reconstruction accuracy include unfamiliar answers?
# categories:
# - Vocabulary
# proof-id: P062
# description: Hide a categorical answer and reconstruct it from numeric context, while varying how many
#   test answers belong to the learned vocabulary.
# execute:
#   enabled: false
#   eval: false
# code-fold: true
# toc: false
# proof-readout:
# - label: Known-answer accuracy, low coverage
#   metric:
#   - known_102
#   - accuracy.content
#   format: percent
# - label: Answers covered
#   metric:
#   - known_102
#   - coverage.content
#   format: percent
# - label: All-answer accuracy
#   metric:
#   - known_102
#   - accuracy.all
#   format: percent
# ---
#
# ## Example
#
# ```yaml
# x: 2.0
# code: class-2
# hide: true
# ```
#
# code is hidden wherever hide is true. Unknown code names cannot be emitted by the learned output vocabulary.
#
# ```{typst}
# //| label: fig-proof-pretraining-coverage
# //| fig-cap: "Selector notes identify hidden values. hide chooses which code answers are hidden."
# //| fig-alt: "Model tree with record, x, code. Selector notes identify hidden values. hide chooses which code answers are hidden."
# #tree(node("record", kind: "root", children: (
#   node("x", type: "Number", detail: "Class coordinate"),
#   node("code", type: "Category", detail: "Reconstruct where hide is true"),
# )))
# ```
#
# ## Comparison
#
# Compare known-answer accuracy, vocabulary coverage, and accuracy over all selected answers.
#
# ## Result
#
# {{< proof P062 status >}}
#
# Known-only accuracy stays high even as coverage falls. Excluding unfamiliar answers from the content score does not mean they were recovered.

# ### Run this experiment
#
# {{< proof P062 script >}}
#
# ### Training and controls
#
# Train for 400 updates on 8,192 rows; storage grows to admit all eight labels.
# Evaluation selects exactly 1,024 of 2,048 independent records. Compare the
# original set with copies retaining 50%, 10%, or 0% of selected target names.
# All copies preserve the exact visible inputs and query-selected masks.
#
# Repeat the 10%-coverage case with unknown targets grouped into separate
# batches. Count-weighted epoch metrics must agree despite all-OOV batches.
# Scores with no known targets must be undefined, not zero reconstruction
# error. Naive accuracy over all selected valued targets counts OOV as wrong.
