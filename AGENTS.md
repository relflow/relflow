# RelFlow Agent Guide

This file is the high-signal context for AI coding agents working in this repo. Prefer it over rediscovering package conventions from scattered tests.

## Package Mental Model

RelFlow builds PyTorch/Lightning models from JSON-like schemas. Users normally import the package as:

```python
import relflow as rf
```

The public surface should stay usable from `relflow` directly: `Model`, `Branch`, built-in tensorfields, data modules, preprocessors, inference writers, deployment helpers, mutation predicates, and extension base classes.

The schema is the architecture. `Model(...)` receives field constructors and branch nodes, then builds the root branch, tensorfield embedders, context encoders, decoders, losses, and prediction outputs.

## Common API Patterns

Minimal supervised model:

```python
model = rf.Model(
    d_model=64,
    n_layers=2,
    n_heads=4,
    amount=rf.Number,
    merchant=rf.Category(size=4096),
    label=rf.Category(target=True, size=2),
)
```

Nested repeated context:

```python
model = rf.Model(
    d_model=64,
    n_layers=2,
    n_heads=4,
    line_items=rf.Branch(
        length=32,
        sku=rf.Category(size=2048),
        quantity=rf.Number,
    ),
    returned=rf.Category(target=True, size=2),
)
```

Root branch naming is passed to `Model(...)` with `name=...`. The
generated root branch is always a singleton; use child `Branch(length=...)`
for repeated data.

```python
model = rf.Model(
    name="event",
    d_model=32,
    n_layers=1,
    n_heads=4,
    embed=True,
    amount=rf.Number,
)
```

## Gotchas

- Do not use a public `Struct(...)` constructor. Public examples should use `Model(...)` and `Branch(...)`.
- `Model(..., name="customer")` names the generated root branch. Older examples may say `root=...`; update them.
- Processed observation names and nesting match the schema by default. A leaf
  may explicitly opt into observation-relative JMESPath extraction with
  `query="[*].source.path"`; RelFlow never infers queries. Prefer an
  `rf.Preprocessor` for sorting, derived values, joins, or coordinated sibling
  transformations.
- `Branch(name="transactions")` reads the same-named child collection, and its
  leaves read keys such as `amount` from each child mapping.
- `Branch(overflow="head")` is the default. Use `overflow="tail"` for recency-ordered histories and `overflow="error"` for strict schemas. The generated root branch uses internal `Overflow.error`.
- `target=True` is shorthand for `p_prune=1.0`; the field is hidden from input and decoded as a supervised target.
- `embed=True` emits an embedding in prediction output. It does not make the field a supervised target.
- `Hash` represents large identifiers with batch-salted hashes, preserving equality across fields in one encoded batch without learning a persistent vocabulary.
- `DateParts` is for calendar parts. If elapsed time or recency matters, derive a `Number`.
- Tensorfield plugins declare their accepted raw atom compatibility families
  with `Plugin(types=...)`. Keep those datatype contracts out of `Request` and
  out of the shared ragged engine.
- Preprocessors run before the shared Awkward tensorization pass. Use them for
  source renaming, Python logic, windowing, normalization, or splitting one raw
  record into multiple observations. Directly bound modeled values and explicit
  query results must be Awkward-compatible. Unmodeled metadata is preserved
  separately and may remain an opaque Python value.
- Postprocessors run after prediction writing. Use them to reshape address-keyed outputs for APIs or warehouses.

## Data And Training

Use `PolarsDataModule(...)` for in-memory examples and docs. Keep examples tiny:

```python
datamodule = rf.PolarsDataModule(
    model=model,
    train=records,
    validate=records,
    num_workers=0,
    persistent_workers=False,
    pin_memory=False,
)
```

For quick examples, train with `max_epochs=1`, `limit_train_batches=1`, and `limit_val_batches=1`.

`model.predict([...])` accepts a list of raw dictionaries and returns an address-keyed dictionary. Configured embeddings appear under `"embedding"`.

## Inference

Top-level inference exports:

- `rf.Writer` writes batch prediction output.
- `rf.Postprocessor` is the postprocess callable type.
- `rf.Deployment`, `rf.API`, `rf.Accelerator`, and related serving types are lazy exports that require `relflow[serving]`.

## Useful Commands

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run pytest tests/test_public_api.py
uv run ty check src/relflow --output-format concise
make render
```

## Documentation Entry Points

- `docs/index.qmd`
- `docs/getting-started.qmd`
- `docs/ai-quickstart.qmd`
- `docs/core-concepts/querypaths.qmd`
- `docs/core-concepts/data-types.qmd`

When adding docs, prefer runnable inline Python snippets and current public
imports. Keep Quarto pages self-contained; do not depend on external standalone
scripts.
